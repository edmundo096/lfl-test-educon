### Ideas not implemented

- Include jQuery, Bootstrap Sass and JS files from *node_modules* and not from CDN.
  - This would permit use and modify Sass variables and mixings making a lot easier to customize. 
- Support processing of JS files, even with support of ES6+ with babel.
- Browser reload plugin/task when source code files changes.
- Process and/or minify source files.
- Enhance and separate gul, to tasks into different files.
- Use a module packager (e.g. webpack) with or to replace gulp.
- Use a template system for HTML (e.g. Pug).
- Use a CLI/generator for the project (e.g. Yeoman, Yeogurt).
- Use a modern front end framework with their CLIs (e.g. Angular, Vue, React).
